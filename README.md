# Stormforce

A simple Flask application that aggregates tidal information from the BBC, WWO
and other locations in order to perform so processing and make data available
to low computation devices such as Garmin watches, IOT devices etc.

At the moment this is very much a work in progress and is absolutely not being
used for any financial purposes.
